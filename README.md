# Laravel CRUD Generator

**Laravel Package to generate CRUD files easily.**  
This is **not** an admin panel generator â€” instead, it is a simple package that generates CRUD operations following the **repository pattern** (without interfaces). It supports full CRUD features **without you needing to write a single line of code**.
